# Washout filter guide:
# - Use 'exponential' for simple directional smoothing with fast rise and adjustable decay.
# - Use 'classical' for more realistic high-pass filtering that preserves transient cues while removing drift.
# - Tune 'decay_*' (0.01–0.05 typical at 20 Hz) for exponential; lower values = slower return to neutral.
# - Tune 'tau_*' (1.0–3.0 seconds typical) for classical; larger τ = smoother and slower decay.
# - All six axes (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw) can be independently configured.
# - 'gain' can amplify or reduce classical filter output; default is 1.0.
# - Optional: 'clip=-1.0:1.0' to constrain classical output to safe actuator ranges.
# 
# Example values for typical platform response at 20 Hz:
# - exponential:
#     decay_x=0.025, decay_y=0.025, decay_z=0.025,
#     decay_roll=0.015, decay_pitch=0.015, decay_yaw=0.02
#     → gives ~95–98% decay over 2–4 seconds
# 
# - classical:
#     tau_x=1.2, tau_y=1.2, tau_z=1.8,
#     tau_roll=1.0, tau_pitch=1.0, tau_yaw=2.2
#     → ~95% decay within 2–6 seconds depending on axis
